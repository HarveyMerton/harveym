# Overview
This project was completed for The University of Auckland's class 'ME706 mechatronics design'. It focuses on full-system integration across mechanical, electrical and software subsystems to solve a general task: navigate to 'fires' (lights) and blow them out while avoiding obstacles. I predominantly worked on behavior coordination and fuzzy logic control for obstacle avoidance.
