# Overview
This project was completed for MIT's graduate class '6.4132 principles of autonomy and decision making' (taught by Prof. Brian Williams). It focuses on higher-level deliberative planning across three areas: activity planning, motion planning and trajectory optimization. Please see the document attached above for a discussion of how each challenge was approached.

# Action planning results
The following action plan can be generated using the fast-forward planner (and breadth-first search) from types, predicates and actions defined in the 'planning domain definition language' (PDDL). The waypoints from this plan are then passed into the sample-based motion planner or trajectory optimizer to generate a motion plan for execution.
