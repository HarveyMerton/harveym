# Overview
With the continued introduction of driverless events to Formula:Society of Automotive Engineers (F:SAE, a.k.a. FS for formula student) competitions around the world, teams are investigating all aspects of the autonomous vehicle stack. This project was entirely conceived and driven by me, and served as the University of Auckland's first step into the autonomous race car space. The work was published in the peer-reviewed Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation (ACRA) 2023. Please see the documents linked above for a comprehensive overview of the project.
