Hi there! My name is Harvey; an avid robotics engineer and world explorer. I am currently a second year Master's student in robotics and autonomous systems at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) [Bioinstrumentation Lab](https://bioinstrumentation.mit.edu/index.html). I am interested in all aspects of AI and ML applied to robotics, but have a particular interest in multi-agent systems; task, behavior and motion planning; and controls. With a Bachelor's degree in mechatronics engineering (from the University of Auckland, New Zealand), I am equally well-versed in robotic cognitive intelligence and its physical embodiment.

Besides robotics I love outdoor adventure sports (surfing, skiing, climbing, hiking, camping) and exploring new experiences and ideas with friends. 

I am currently on the lookout for my next challenge! Please feel free to have a poke around this (under construction) website for an idea of my [recent projects](https://harveymerton.github.io/harveym/portfolio/), and my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harveymerton/) for an idea of my experience. I am responsive through LinkedIn should you have any questions!
